# Multiplayer Physics Based Character Movement Component
This project is a sandbox project for Networked Physics movement.
In order to enable that we have to extend the base Character Movement Component for networked physics based movement.
With some tweaks to the project it can be used for a space game, Drone simulator etc.

The plan for this project is to evolve into a multiplayer lunar lander example.
